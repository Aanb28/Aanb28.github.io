        <h1>Unit 11: Model Selection and Evaluation</h1>
          <p>Understanding model assessment and selection, the two very crucial steps in machine learning workflow is made possible by this unit. Choosing the right model or models is no different that choosing the right tool or tools to do a certain task, in this case prediction or classification in machine learning.</p>
          
            <h2>E portfolio activity: </h2>
            <p>Run the <a href=" https://www.my-course.co.uk/pluginfile.php/1196408/mod_page/content/3/Unit11_model_Performance_Measurement.ipynb">model_Performance_Measurement.ipnyb</a> file (to be shared) and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error</p>
            <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals</p>
            <h4>AUC (Area Under the Curve)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularization: To help avoid overfitting, which would result in a drop in AUC if the model was overfitting, I experimented with altering the regularization (for example, L1 or L2 regularization). But I came to understand that too much regularization can lead to underfitting, which lowers AUC.</li>
                <li>Learning Rate: Attempting a greater learning rate causes the model to overshoot the optimal solution, which lowers the AUC, but it also speeds up convergence. A lower learning rate, in my opinion, is more stable but takes longer to converge.</li>
                <li>Iteration count: As the model has more time to converge to a better solution, the AUC improves with an increase in iterations. On the other hand, overfitting from too many iterations lowers the AUC.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>R2 Error</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularization: Increasing regularization reduces R2 error, much like AUC. Excessive regularization, on the other hand, may underfit and lower R2 error.</li>
                <li>Learning Rate: A higher learning rate causes the model to overshoot the optimal solution, which raises the R2 error, but it also speeds up convergence. Similar to regularization, a lower learning rate is more stable but could take longer to converge.</li>
                <li>Iterations: As the model has more time to converge to a better solution, more iterations typically result in a lower R2 error. On the other hand, overfitting from too many iterations raises the R2 error.</li>
            </ul>
