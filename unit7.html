        <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</p>
        <h4>Simple Perceptron</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Parameters:</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning Rate: I find that a larger learning rate leads to overshooting the optimal solution but also converges more quickly. Although it takes longer to converge, a lower learning rate is more stable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Operator AND Perceptron</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Modifications to Data:</strong> 
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Feature Representation: You are aware that binary features are assumed by the AND operator. The model must be modified to account for changes in feature representation or the inclusion of additional features.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Model Parameters: </strong>
                         <ul>
                        <li>Weights: The AND operator's weights are normally set to -2 for the bias and 1 for both inputs. The decision boundary changes when these values are changed.</li>
                         </ul>
                   </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Multi-Layer Perceptron (Sigmoid Function)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Modifications to Data: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feature Scaling: I find that performance is enhanced by feature scaling.</li>
                    <li>Noise: Noise also has an impact on the model's accuracy. Techniques for noise reduction and data cleansing are crucial.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Model Parameters: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning Rate: Similar to the simple perceptron, convergence speed and stability are influenced by the learning rate.</li>
                    <li>Initialization: The convergence path and ultimate solution are impacted by the initialization of weights and biases. The convergence was impacted when I experimented with random initialization.</li>
                    <li>Hidden Layers: I found that the capacity and complexity of the model are influenced by the number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer. Although I noticed that the model is occasionally overfitting, extra layers and neurons may be able to learn more intricate patterns.</li>
                    <li>Activation Function: I also discovered that the model's capacity to learn non-linear relationships is impacted by the activation function I used (such as ReLU or tanh).</li>
                </ul>  
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The performance of perceptron models is generally greatly impacted by modifications to the data or model parameters. Finding the best configuration for a particular problem frequently requires experimentation and parameter modification.</p>
